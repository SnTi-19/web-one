        <h3>Style and attitude</h3>
        <p>
          The Pink Panther doesn’t even need to speak to show how confident and stylish he is. Every move he makes—whether he’s walking down the street or sneaking into a scene—is smooth, calm, and full of personality.

          <h3>Humor</h3>
          <p>
            Even though the original cartoons are decades old, the Pink Panther’s comedy still works today. It’s smart, visual, and doesn’t rely on words—so anyone, anywhere can enjoy it.

          <h3>Iconic music</h3>
          <p>
            That jazzy saxophone theme is instantly recognizable and perfectly matches his chill personality. It’s one of those tunes that makes any moment feel stylish just by hearing it.
